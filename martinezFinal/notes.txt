Final Project
Due Friday Midnight

- expanded from midterm pizza ordering from
- the difference is that in the midterm we worked with javascript,
  now in final will be only working with jquery 

The file will need to be modified:
- use document.ready()
- data validation to check for phone numbers and email address in pure jquery
- don't worry aboutt the slideshow 
- when you place order in order details, you will save each radio button selection
   saved in the local storage or cookie (CHECK SAMPLE WEEK 15 for this CODE)
   to prove you saved it: more tools > local storage ,session, or cookie
   each time you save you create one string, the message, and concatnate in the cookie
